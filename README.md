📝 Project Description
We developed a data science project focused on analyzing daily ridership data provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which operates New York’s largest public transport network.

Our goal was to:

Analyze ridership trends across multiple services (Subways, Buses, Railroads, Traffic)

Compare post-COVID ridership levels with pre-pandemic benchmarks

Provide data-driven recommendations to support transportation planning and recovery strategies

📊 Dataset Overview
Total Rows: 1706

Total Columns: 15

Date Range: March 2020 to October 2024

Key Attributes:

Date (Primary Key)

Total Estimated Ridership

% of Comparable Pre-Pandemic Day

Service-specific ridership: Subways, Buses, Metro North, LIRR, AAR, Traffic

🛠 Techniques Used
Data Cleaning & Preparation

Feature Engineering

Calculating COVID recovery percentages

Weekday vs. Weekend classification

Filtering 2019 data for benchmarking

Visualization Tools:

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Time Series & Trend Analysis

🚀 Dashboard/API Overview
(Coming Soon)

Web-based interface for interactive analysis

Visual comparisons across services

Seasonality insights

Filtered dashboards for Weekdays, Weekends, and Seasons

🔥 Key Insights
All services experienced a sharp decline in 2020

Subways recovered faster and more consistently, especially during 2023 and 2024

October recorded the highest ridership across all years

No service surpassed a 75% recovery level

Traffic via bridges and tunnels had the strongest recovery (+3%)

Access-A-Ride (AAR) recovered by approximately 25%

Winter months had the lowest ridership; fall had the highest

Buses were initially higher than subways post-COVID but were surpassed by subways in late 2022

Metro North and Long Island Rail Road showed synchronized trends – possibly influenced by external factors

Staten Island had the lowest total and recovery percentage

✅ Recommendations
Increase staff, cleaning, and service availability in October, the peak ridership month

Use October for public campaigns and new service announcements.

Plan maintenance and cost-saving actions in January and February, when ridership is low

Expand high-demand bus routes and reduce wait times

Develop unified strategies for Metro North and LIRR due to similar behavior
