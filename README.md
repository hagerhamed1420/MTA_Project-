## 📝 **Project Description**

We developed a **data science project** focused on analyzing **daily ridership data** provided by the **Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)**, which operates the **largest public transport network in New York**.

**Our goal was to:**
- Analyze ridership trends across multiple services (Subways, Buses, Railroads, Traffic)
- Compare post-COVID ridership levels with pre-pandemic benchmarks
- Provide data-driven recommendations to support transportation planning and recovery strategies

---

## 📊 **Dataset Overview**

- **Total Rows:** 1706  
- **Total Columns:** 15  
- **Date Range:** March 2020 to October 2024  

**Key Attributes:**
- `Date` (Primary Key)  
- `Total Estimated Ridership`  
- `% of Comparable Pre-Pandemic Day`  
- Service-specific ridership: Subways, Buses, Metro North, LIRR, AAR, Traffic

---

## 🛠 **Techniques Used**

- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- **Feature Engineering**, including:
  - Calculating COVID recovery percentages
  - Weekday vs. Weekend classification
  - Filtering 2019 data for benchmarking
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Time Series & Trend Analysis**
- **Visualization Tool:** Power BI

---

## 🚀 **Dashboard/API Overview**

The project includes an upcoming **interactive dashboard** for advanced ridership analysis.

### **Features**
- Web-based interface for ridership insights
- Visual comparisons across all MTA services
- Seasonality analysis (fall/winter trends)
- Filtering options by weekday, weekend, or transport type

---

## 🔥 **Key Insights**

- All services experienced a **sharp decline in 2020**
- **Subways recovered faster** and more consistently, especially during **2023 and 2024**
- **October** recorded the **highest ridership** across all years
- **No service surpassed a 75% recovery** level
- **Bridges and tunnels traffic** showed the **strongest recovery** (+3%)
- **Access-A-Ride (AAR)** recovered by approximately **25%**
- **Winter had the lowest ridership**; **fall had the highest**
- **Buses initially exceeded subways** post-COVID, but were surpassed by subways by **late 2022**
- **Metro North and Long Island Rail Road** showed **synchronized trends**
- **Staten Island** had the **lowest total** and **recovery percentage**

---

## ✅ **Recommendations**

- **Increase staff, cleaning, and service availability** in **October**, the peak ridership month  
- Use **October** for **public awareness campaigns** and **new service announcements**  
- Schedule **maintenance and cost-saving measures** during **January and February**, when ridership is low  
- **Expand high-demand bus routes** and **reduce waiting times**  
- Develop **unified strategies** for **Metro North and LIRR** based on their synchronized behavior
